## Who we are, and what we do:

The University of Warwick Computing Society is a free-to-join academic society open to anyone with an interest in the field of computer science. Our community consists of a wide, welcoming network of both current and graduate students proficient with many languages, concepts, and technologies. We regularly host industry speakers.

Our primary focus is academia. We hold various talks, workshops, and coding challenges - and aim to support you throughout your time at the university through revision sessions and introductory resources. We also host weekly social and gaming events throughout the term, along with larger, less frequent events: Ranging from campus barbecues and weekend-long LAN parties, to laser tag or even a trip to Bletchley Park! We value collaboration with other societies, and have a long-standing relationship with the Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick.
